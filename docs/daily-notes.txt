1. What is Angular?
2. Why Angular?

- it is a new name given to javascript
- Building dynamic web applications.
- Platform to build client applications
- framework to create final javascript code
- platform to build web app
- It is an open source full featured JavaScript framework.
- that renders as web pages talking to each other
- (Single page application)SPA development, faster loads hole application
- its a platform for building mobile and desktop web application.
- Javascript framework

- we did have web app using jsp, asp and servlets
- JSP & Servlets
- made it easy to develop earlier manolithic web app
- web app was difficult to make it modularized
- single page application hence no page reload
- we need more of reusable
- scripting language was not strictly typed

3. What is the difference between jQuery and Angular?
- both are very different :-)
- JQuery and Angular have no word common :-D
- jquery makes javascript more simpler, smaller
- jquery depends on dom elements availability
- no restapi only ajax calls
- jquery is a library , anguler is a framework
- jquery library, angular is framework

4. Library vs Framework
- libraries are already built
- framework is guideline to build and extend
- lib is limited
- A library offers functions , whereas a framework defines the entire application design.
- framework will evolve
- we are calling library function, framework IOC
- Frameworks will be derived based on best practices
- there can be more libs, but only one framework

 Traditional Web App
 - ASP.NET, Servlets, JSP, PHP, Python
   - Server side rendering - HTML is generated on server
   
 - Angular, React, Vue
   - Client side rendering - HTML is generated on the browser
   
LINQ

Dead code elimination - Tree shaking

N-Tier Apps
1. UI - Angular - Angular              - Angular               - Angular / React / Vue.js / jQuery
2. BL - Node.js - MS.NET (Asp.net MVC) - Java (SpringBoot)     - PHP / Python
3. DL - MongoDB - MS SQL Server        - Oracle / MySql Server - MySQL


var n1: number, n2: number;

n1 = 10;
n2 = 10;   // number

...


n2 = 'Hi';  // string


...


result = n1 / n2;
